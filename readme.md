# Teletext In Vision Decoder Board

This repo is an attempt to open-source my teletext decoder.

It was originally designed, tested, and even a few were sold by me in 2019.

You can see the [original product page for it on my website](https://www.nathanmediaservices.co.uk/invision/).

You are now free to do whatever you like with this design and the firmware for it.

Disclaimer: the design and firmwares are offered completely as-is, with no warranty of any kind. I will no longer be offering support or assistance on this project, if you want to build one you must figure it out from the resources provided here. 

- Why are there so many different firmwares?

Because I have built various slightly different boards into different projects and cases for different purposes, and with different ancillaries. For example, there are code bases here which support LCD screens, IR remotes, thumbwheel selectors, serial remotes, etc. You'll probably need to try a few and modify them to suit your needs.

If you do decide to do something cool with this design, please consider posting photos of it to Bluesky and tagging "@nmsni.co.uk", I would love to see it!

Also... consider kicking a quid or two my way at [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/avrovulcanxh607). It took a fair bit of time to figure this out.
